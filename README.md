## Project Name - Zoomba NFT Ticketing platform on Reef chain

#### Project Description: We are building an on-chain ticketing solution that allows the event managers to create tickets for their event doesn’t matter if it’s online or an IRL event just create a ticket on Zoomba and sell those directly through the portal, this can even be useful for token gating the discord channels based on the event that’s taking place currently.


### Current Features - Currently with our MVP a user can connect his wallet and buy tickets to different events
- A user can come and create a new event.
- A user can add the total supply of the tickets
- Add the price of an individual ticket
- Can add a cap on number of tickets that can be minted by a wallet
- Can add metadata to his NFT
